##### This repo is about be upgrading former version **VibraWhore** which was not released.

## Project Overview
#### JiggleJacker is a security research project that takes a cheeky look at the vulnerabilities in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled adult toys, like vibrators and dildos. Our goal? To show how easy it is to take control of these devices—and maybe get a few giggles while doing it.

## Objectives
* **Scan & Find**: Locate nearby BLE-enabled adult toys, because, **let’s face it, they’re out there**.
* **Take Control**: Remotely activate or deactivate these toys, and prove how simple it is to mess with someone’s pleasure.
* **Raise Awareness**: Shine a light on the security holes in IoT-connected adult devices—and give you some laughs in the process.
* 
## Key Features
* BLE Scanning: Discover Bluetooth-enabled adult devices in your vicinity. (Don’t be shy, they’re everywhere.)
* Remote Control: Activate, deactivate, or just have fun with the devices you find (you know, for educational purposes).
* Fun & Learning: A playful exploration of security flaws in the adult toy industry—because learning about IoT vulnerabilities can be fun, too!


### Reminder: JiggleJacker is for educational purposes only. It’s all about laughing, learning, and raising awareness about the vulnerabilities in connected devices.
